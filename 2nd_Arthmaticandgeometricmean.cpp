/*Arthmatic Progression 
2,4,6,8,10....
every number has a difference of 2 --> first number a=2 and difference d=2
2nd term -->a+d
3rd term-->a+2d......nth term -->a+(n-1)d
average = sum/n --> sum=avg*n --> we can get avg by (first term + last term)/2
sum=n/2*(a+a+(n-1)d) --> n/2*(2a+(n-1)d)

Geometric Progression 
2,4,8,16,32...
first term r=2 second term a*r, a*r^2,...nth term a*r^n-1
sum=a(1-r^n)/1-r 

Mean and median 
Mean:- the mean is found by adding up on all the data and divide them by the number of 
data entires 
Example:- the mean of 5,8,2 is (5+8+2)/3-->5
Median:- the middle number : found by odering all data and picking out one in the
middle (or there are two middle numbers take the mean of the two numbers)
Example :- the median of 5,8,2 is 5 because order them 2,5,8
